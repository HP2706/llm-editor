# Simple Website for File Editing

This website allows you to upload your files in Word or Markdown format and have them edited by an LLM (Language Learning Model). The editing process is streamed in real-time from the backend using the **Instructor** library. The editor itself is straightforward, utilizing the **Lexical** library for processing.

## Key Features

- **File Upload:** Supports Word or Markdown formats.
- **Real-Time Editing:** Utilizes the Instructor library for streaming edits.
- **Simple Editor:** Powered by the Lexical library.

## Important Notes

- **File Conversion:** When you re-download your edited file, be aware that formatting may be lost. This is due to the conversion process: Word/Markdown -> HTML -> Lexical -> HTML -> Word/Markdown. Unfortunately i have not been able  to find a simpler way to do this.
- **Processing Time:** After initiating the edit, there may be a delay before streaming begins. This delay is necessary for booting up a modal server.

Please be patient and allow some time for the system to process your request.
